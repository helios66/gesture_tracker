Gesture to Speech Transcription System
======================================

This is a copy of the implementation code for final year project written in the Processing Programming Language and The Microsoft Kinect. 

It is the primitive level of a gesture to speech transcription system for American Sign Languages.

It is currently at the stage where I track fingers.

I gave up. Yeah, I'm sorry.
